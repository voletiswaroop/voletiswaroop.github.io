I started my journey as a Frontend Developer in 2012. I have extensive experience in building responsive and adaptive user interfaces for web apps catering to a spectrum of devices such as Desktops, Tablets & Mobiles. I have worked on many projects in different sectors such as E-Commerce, Mobile, Banking and Healthcare, all of them are from scratch. I am inquisitive, confident and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
